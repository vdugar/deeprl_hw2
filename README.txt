The code is organized as follows-
dqn_atari.py: Contains architecture definitions for all models, along with the main function that runs a particular network.
deeprl_hw2/dqn.py: Implements an agent according to the DQN algorithm
deeprl_hw2/double_dqn.py: Implements an agent according to the Double DQN algorithm
deeprl_hw2/linear_dqn.py: Implements an agent according to the Linear DQN algorithm (with or without experience replay and target fixing)
